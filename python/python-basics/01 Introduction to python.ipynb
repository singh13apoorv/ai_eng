    "Python is an interpreted programming language, that means instead of compiling the complete code and then running, it runs each line of code one by one. So, unlike compiled languages if your code is having error in lets say line number 13 then your code will run till line number 12 and then throw error.\n",
    "Python is also a loosely typed language, which means that you don't need to specify the typep of any variable but still if you want to use strict typing in your code then you can do it. If you have already applied type to a variable then you can't assign any value to that variable but you have to assign the value of the type of variable. We will see all this in future, so for now don't worry."
